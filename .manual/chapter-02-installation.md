### 2.1 Prerequisites

**Required**

- Go 1.26 or later
- Internet connection (for downloading libraries and models)

**Recommended**

- GPU with Metal (macOS), CUDA (NVIDIA), or Vulkan support
- 16GB+ system RAM (96GB+ Recommended)

### 2.2 Installing the CLI

**Option 1: Homebrew (recommended for macOS and Linux)**

```shell
brew tap ardanlabs/kronk
brew install kronk
```

To upgrade later:

```shell
brew upgrade kronk
```

The Homebrew formula is published from the [ardanlabs/homebrew-kronk](https://github.com/ardanlabs/homebrew-kronk) tap and is updated automatically on every Kronk release.

**Option 2: Go install (any supported platform)**

```shell
go install github.com/ardanlabs/kronk/cmd/kronk@latest
```

**Option 3: Pre-built binary**

Download the appropriate archive for your OS and architecture from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ardanlabs/kronk/releases), extract the `kronk` binary, and place it on your `PATH`.

**Verify the installation**

```shell
kronk --help
```

```

### 2.3 Installing Libraries

Before running inference, you need the llama.cpp libraries for your machine. Kronk auto-detects your hardware and downloads the appropriate binaries.

**Option A: Via the Server**

Start the server and use the BUI to download libraries:

```shell
kronk server start
```

Open http://localhost:11435 in your browser and navigate to the Libraries page.

**Option B: Via CLI**

```shell
kronk libs --local
```

This downloads the **well-known default version** of llama.cpp baked into
the SDK and installs it under
`~/.kronk/libraries/<os>/<arch>/<processor>/` using auto-detected settings
(for example `~/.kronk/libraries/darwin/arm64/metal/`). Each
`(arch, os, processor)` triple lives in its own folder so multiple
bundles can coexist on the same machine.

To track and install the **latest** llama.cpp release instead of the
default version, opt in with `--upgrade`:

```shell
kronk libs --local --upgrade
```

> The standalone CLI defaults to the pinned default version so reinstalls
> are reproducible. The model server takes the opposite default
> (`--allow-upgrade=true`) so a long-running server picks up upstream
> fixes; see Chapter 8 §8.3 for that flag.

**Pinning a Specific Library Version**

Sometimes there are breaking changes to llama.cpp that require a matching version of yzma and Kronk. To ensure stability, you can install a specific library version:

```shell
kronk libs --version=b8864 --local
```

Or via environment variable:

```shell
KRONK_LIB_VERSION=b8864 kronk libs --local
```

Here are the known compatible versions:

| llama.cpp | yzma    | kronk  |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| b8864     | v1.12.0 | 1.23.1 |
| b8865+    | v1.13.0 | 1.23.2 |

If you experience unexpected behavior after a library upgrade, pin the version that matches your installed Kronk release using the table above.

**Environment Variables for Library Installation**

```
KRONK_LIB_PATH  - Library directory. See "KRONK_LIB_PATH semantics" below.
KRONK_PROCESSOR - `cpu`, `cuda`, `metal`, `rocm`, or `vulkan` (default: `cpu`)
KRONK_ARCH      - Architecture override: `amd64`, `arm64`
KRONK_OS        - OS override: `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`
```

**KRONK_LIB_PATH semantics**

`KRONK_LIB_PATH` is interpreted in one of three ways:

1. _Unset_ — the runtime resolves
   `<base>/libraries/<os>/<arch>/<processor>/` based on the detected (or
   `KRONK_*`-overridden) triple.
2. _Points at a directory containing a `version.json`_ — used as-is. This
   is the form to set when you want to switch the active install to a
   previously-downloaded triple folder. Example:

   ```shell
   export KRONK_LIB_PATH=~/.kronk/libraries/linux/amd64/cuda
   ```

3. _Points at a non-empty directory without a `version.json`_ — treated as
   a user-managed read-only build. Kronk will load libraries from it but
   never write to it; mutating CLI/HTTP operations against it return an
   error.

Switching the active install requires a server restart; libraries are not
hot-reloaded.

**Example: Install CUDA Libraries**

```shell
KRONK_PROCESSOR=cuda kronk libs --local
```

**Installing for Another Triple**

You can also install a bundle for a triple other than the current
machine's detected one — useful for prepping a shared filesystem or a
target host. The install lands in its own folder under the libraries
root and does not touch the active install:

```shell
# List every supported (arch, os, processor) combination
kronk libs --list-combinations

# Install the Linux/CUDA bundle alongside whatever is already active
kronk libs --install --arch=amd64 --os=linux --processor=cuda --local

# List installed bundles
kronk libs --list-installs

# Remove an install
kronk libs --remove-install --arch=amd64 --os=linux --processor=cuda --local
```

In web mode (the default — no `--local`) the same commands are dispatched
through the running server. Activate any installed bundle by exporting
`KRONK_LIB_PATH` to its folder and restarting the server.

### 2.4 Downloading Your First Model

Kronk maintains your **personal catalog** at `~/.kronk/catalog.yaml`. On
first run it is seeded from an embedded starter list so you have something
to choose from immediately; the catalog grows as you pull more models or
resolve new IDs against HuggingFace.

List entries in the catalog:

```shell
kronk catalog list --local
```

Output:

```
VAL   MODEL ID                                            PROVIDER    FAMILY                              ARCH      MTMD   SIZE
✓     ggml-org/embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0               ggml-org    embeddinggemma-300m-qat-q8_0-GGUF   bert      -      329.0 MB
✓     unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0                             unsloth     Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF                     qwen3     -      699.0 MB
✗     bartowski/cerebras_Qwen3-Coder-REAP-25B-A3B-Q8_0    bartowski   Qwen3-Coder-REAP-25B-A3B-GGUF       qwen3moe  -      26.5 GB
✗     unsloth/LFM2.5-VL-1.6B-Q8_0                         unsloth     LFM2.5-VL-1.6B-GGUF                 lfm2      ✓      1.7 GB
```

The `VAL` column shows whether the model files have been downloaded and
validated locally; `MTMD` indicates a multimodal projection (mmproj) is
present.

Download a model (recommended starter: Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0):

```shell
kronk model pull Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0 --local
```

Models are stored in `~/.kronk/models/<provider>/<family>/` by default.
After the pull completes the catalog entry is updated with the resolved
provider, family, revision, and file sizes so subsequent lookups don't
need to hit HuggingFace.

### 2.5 Starting the Server

Start the Kronk Model Server:

```shell
kronk server start
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:11435` by default. You'll see output like:

```
Kronk Model Server started
API: http://localhost:11435
BUI: http://localhost:11435
```

**Running in Background**

To run the server as a background process:

```shell
kronk server start -d
```

**Stopping the Server**

```shell
kronk server stop
```

### 2.6 Model Configuration File

When Kronk starts the server for the first time, it automatically installs a default `model_config.yaml` file in the `~/.kronk/` directory. This file controls how each model behaves when loaded by the server — context window size, batch processing, caching, sampling parameters, and more.

**How It Works**

The default configuration is embedded inside the Kronk CLI binary. On first server start, if `~/.kronk/model_config.yaml` does not already exist, Kronk writes the embedded default to that path. Once the file exists, Kronk never overwrites it — your edits are preserved across upgrades.

The server logs the path it's using on startup:

```
startup  status=model config  path=/Users/you/.kronk/model_config.yaml
```

**File Structure**

The file is a YAML document where each top-level key is a model ID (or a model ID with a config variant suffix). Under each key you set the configuration options for that model. Here's a simplified example:

```yaml
Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0:
  context-window: 32768
  sampling-parameters:
    temperature: 0.7
    top_p: 0.8
    top_k: 20

unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-UD-Q4_K_M/AGENT:
  context-window: 131072
  nseq-max: 2
  sampling-parameters:
    temperature: 1.0
    top_k: 64
    top_p: 0.95

Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0/YARN:
  context-window: 131072
  rope-scaling-type: yarn
  yarn-orig-ctx: 32768
```

The `/YARN` suffix is a **config variant** — it lets you define multiple configurations for the same model. When making an API request, use the full variant name (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0/YARN`) as the `model` field to select that configuration.

**Available Options**

The file includes a commented reference at the top listing every option. Here are the most commonly used:

| Option                | Description                                            | Default |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `context-window`      | Max tokens the model can process per request           | 8192    |
| `ngpu-layers`         | GPU layers to offload (0 = all, -1 = none)             | 0       |
| `flash-attention`     | Flash Attention mode: `enabled`, `disabled`, `auto`    | auto    |
| `incremental-cache`   | Enable IMC for agentic workflows                       | true    |
| `nseq-max`            | Max parallel sequences for batched inference           | 0       |
| `nbatch`              | Logical batch size                                     | 2048    |
| `nubatch`             | Physical batch size for prompt ingestion               | 512     |
| `cache-type-k`        | KV cache key quantization: `f16`, `q8_0`, `q4_0`, etc. | —       |
| `cache-type-v`        | KV cache value quantization                            | —       |
| `sampling-parameters` | Nested block for temperature, top_p, top_k, min_p      | —       |

For the complete list of options and detailed explanations, see [Chapter 3: Model Configuration](chapter-03-model-configuration.md).

**Editing the File**

Open the file in any text editor:

```shell
# macOS
open ~/.kronk/model_config.yaml

# Linux
nano ~/.kronk/model_config.yaml
```

After editing, restart the server to apply changes:

```shell
kronk server stop
kronk server start
```

**Configuration Priority**

When the server loads a model, configuration is resolved through two
layers (plus sampling defaults):

1. **Analysis defaults** — Hardware-aware values inferred from the GGUF
   metadata and the local devices (context window, batch sizes, cache
   types, flash attention, GPU layers).
2. **`model_config.yaml` overrides** — Your per-model overrides merged on
   top of the analysis defaults. Anything you set here wins.
3. **Sampling defaults** — Any zero-valued sampling fields are filled in
   from the SDK's built-in sampling defaults so the model always has a
   complete sampler configuration.

The catalog itself is **not** part of this layering — it is a resolution
cache (provider, family, revision, files) and not a source of tuning
knobs. All tuning lives in `model_config.yaml` (or in `model.Config` when
you're embedding the SDK directly).

**Tips**

- The key is the canonical model id — `provider/modelID` (for example
  `unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0`) or a variant such as
  `unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0/IMC` — not a file name.
- Use YAML anchors (`&name` and `<<: *name`) to share common settings between variants. The default file includes examples of this pattern.
- The `--model-config` server flag lets you point to an alternative config file for testing without modifying your main one.

### 2.7 Verifying the Installation

**Test via curl**

```shell
curl http://localhost:11435/v1/models
```

You should see a list of available models.

**Test Chat Completion**

_Note: It might take a few seconds the first time you call this because the
model needs to be loaded into memory first._

```shell
curl http://localhost:11435/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

**Test via BUI**

Open `http://localhost:11435` in your browser and navigate to the `Apps/Chat` app. Select the model you want to try and chat away.

### 2.8 Quick Start Summary

```shell
# 1. Install Kronk
go install github.com/ardanlabs/kronk/cmd/kronk@latest

# 2. Start the server (auto-installs libraries on first run)

  -d '{"model": "Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

### 2.9 NixOS Setup

NixOS does not follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), so shared
libraries and binaries cannot be found in standard paths like `/usr/lib`. Kronk
requires llama.cpp shared libraries at runtime, which means on NixOS you need to
provide them through Nix rather than using the built-in `kronk libs` downloader.

A `flake.nix` is provided in `zarf/nix/` with dev shells for development and
build packages for producing a standalone `kronk` binary, each per GPU backend.

**Prerequisites**

- NixOS or Nix package manager with flakes enabled
- A supported GPU (Vulkan or CUDA), or CPU-only mode

**Available Dev Shells**

The flake provides multiple shells, one per GPU backend:

| Command                         | Backend | GPU Required         |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `nix develop ./zarf/nix`        | CPU     | None                 |
| `nix develop ./zarf/nix#cpu`    | CPU     | None                 |
| `nix develop ./zarf/nix#vulkan` | Vulkan  | Vulkan-capable GPU   |
| `nix develop ./zarf/nix#cuda`   | CUDA    | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA |

**Building the Kronk CLI**

The flake also provides build packages that produce a wrapped `kronk` binary
with the correct llama.cpp backend and runtime libraries baked in:

| Command                       | Backend | GPU Required         |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `nix build ./zarf/nix`        | CPU     | None                 |
| `nix build ./zarf/nix#cpu`    | CPU     | None                 |
| `nix build ./zarf/nix#vulkan` | Vulkan  | Vulkan-capable GPU   |
| `nix build ./zarf/nix#cuda`   | CUDA    | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA |

The Go binary is built and then wrapped per backend so
that `KRONK_LIB_PATH`, `KRONK_ALLOW_UPGRADE`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are set
automatically. No dev shell is required to run the resulting binary.

**Note:** The `vendorHash` in the flake must be updated whenever `go.mod` or
`go.sum` changes. Build with a fake hash and Nix will report the correct one.

**Environment Variables**

All shells and built packages automatically set the following:

| Variable              | Value                                    | Purpose                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `KRONK_LIB_PATH`      | Nix store path to the selected llama.cpp | Points Kronk to the Nix-managed llama.cpp libraries  |
| `KRONK_ALLOW_UPGRADE` | `false`                                  | Prevents Kronk from attempting to download libraries |
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`     | Includes `libffi` and `libstdc++`        | Required for FFI runtime linking                     |

**Important:** Because `KRONK_ALLOW_UPGRADE` is set to `false`, the `kronk libs`
command will not attempt to download or overwrite libraries. Library updates are
managed through `nix flake update` instead.

**Troubleshooting**

- **Library not found errors:** Ensure you are inside the `nix develop` shell
  or using a `nix build` output. The required `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and
  `KRONK_LIB_PATH` are only set within the shell or the wrapped binary.
- **Vulkan not detected:** Verify your GPU drivers are installed at the NixOS
  system level (`hardware.opengl.enable = true` and appropriate driver packages
  in your NixOS configuration).
- **Go version mismatch:** The flake pins a specific Go version. If Kronk
  requires a newer version, update the `go_1_26` package reference in
  `flake.nix`.
- **vendorHash mismatch:** After updating Go dependencies, rebuild with a fake
  hash (e.g. `lib.fakeHash`) and Nix will print the correct `vendorHash`.
